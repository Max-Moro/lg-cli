# Cleanup Redundant Comments in C/C++ Profiles

## Problem

Files `c/code_profiles.py` and `cpp/code_profiles.py` contain comments that repeat what the code already says.

## Target Files

- `lg/adapters/langs/c/code_profiles.py`
- `lg/adapters/langs/cpp/code_profiles.py`

## Examples to Remove

### C code_profiles.py

```python
# Remove these redundant section headers and obvious comments:

# === Functions ===
# C doesn't have classes, all functions are top-level
ElementProfile(
    name="function",
    ...
)

# === Structs ===
# Struct definitions (not declarations in function signatures)
ElementProfile(
    name="struct",
    ...
)

# === Unions ===
# Union type definitions
ElementProfile(
    name="union",
    ...
)
```

### C++ code_profiles.py

```python
# Remove these:

# === Namespaces ===
ElementProfile(
    name="namespace",
    ...
)

# === Classes ===
ElementProfile(
    name="class",
    ...
)

# === Structs ===
ElementProfile(
    name="struct",
    ...
)
```

## What to Keep

Keep comments that explain **non-obvious behavior**:

```python
# KEEP: explains why query is structured this way
# Struct fields inside struct_specifier, filtered to exclude function parameters
ElementProfile(
    name="field",
    query="(field_declaration) @element",
    additional_check=lambda node, doc: _is_inside_struct(node),
)

# KEEP: explains language-specific behavior
# In C++, default visibility is private for class, public for struct
if parent_type == "class":
    return False  # Default for class is private

# KEEP: documents a workaround
# Note: secondary_constructor directly has 'block' child (no function_body wrapper)
```

## Pattern

Apply this cleanup pattern:

1. **Remove** `# === SectionName ===` headers — the profile name is self-documenting
2. **Remove** comments that just repeat profile name: `# Class declarations`
3. **Remove** comments stating the obvious: `# Check if node has static specifier`
4. **Keep** comments explaining WHY, not WHAT
5. **Keep** comments about language quirks and edge cases
6. **Keep** comments about tree-sitter AST peculiarities

## Estimated Changes

- `c/code_profiles.py`: remove ~15-20 lines of comments
- `cpp/code_profiles.py`: remove ~20-25 lines of comments
